Contingent Coupon Auto-Callable Note Valuation using Binomial Tree
===================================================================

ðŸ“ˆ Overview
-----------
This project presents a robust implementation of a **Binomial Tree model** to price a **Contingent Coupon Auto-Callable Note** linked to the common stock of **Applied Materials, Inc.** The product pays conditional coupons and may be called early if certain stock price thresholds are met on predefined observation dates. The goal is to replicate the term sheetâ€™s payout logic using backward induction on a recombining binomial lattice.

The final model estimates a note value of **$9.7446**, closely matching the term sheetâ€™s value of **$9.76**, confirming high accuracy.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
---------------
- Constructed a **CRR-based binomial tree** with 251 time steps (daily granularity)
- Integrated **auto-call and coupon barrier logic** in backward induction
- Incorporated **forward rate regime shifts** and market-implied **dividend yield**
- Used Bloomberg for real-time **discount factors, implied volatilities**, and **dividend yield**
- Conducted detailed **sensitivity analyses**:
  - Volatility impact
  - Coupon barrier variations
  - Convergence behavior across different time steps

ðŸ§® Financial Specifications
---------------------------
- **Underlying:** Applied Materials Inc. (Ticker: AMAT)
- **Contingent Coupon Rate:** 11.35%
- **Initial Value:** $190.70
- **Coupon Barrier & Downside Threshold:** $123.96 (65% of initial value)
- **Maturity:** 01/28/2026
- **Observation Dates:** Quarterly (Apr, Jul, Oct, Jan)
- **Note Value Estimated:** $9.7446 (vs Term Sheet: $9.76)

ðŸ§  Methodology
--------------
1. **Stock Tree Generation**:
   - Used Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) method to calculate up/down factors.
   - Used daily steps to create a recombining lattice.

2. **Valuation Tree**:
   - Backward induction incorporating:
     - Auto-call condition
     - Coupon eligibility check
     - Downside payoff logic
   - Used forward rates per regime to compute discounting and risk-neutral probabilities.

3. **Data Inputs**:
   - SOFR rates interpolated from Bloomberg swap discount factors
   - AMAT dividend yield = 2.071%
   - Implied volatility (Ïƒ) = 37.797% (approximated for numerical tractability)

ðŸ“Š Sensitivity Analysis
------------------------
- Volatility has **nonlinear** effects on pricing due to discrete barrier interaction
- Coupon barrier above initial value shows **valuation ceiling** due to auto-call dominance
- Convergence analysis reveals **oscillatory error patterns**â€”accuracy depends on step alignment with observation dates
